A remote is a public repository that corresponds to your local repository. When you cloned this respostory from the file server, a 
remote was automatically added to this project. Use "git remote -v" to see it. Origin is always the name of the main remote. You can 
add additonal remotes, but this wont be necessary now.

Now that you have a local commit, you can push it to remote. The next person to clone this repository will see your changes. If they
have already cloned the repository, they can pull your changes to merge the code with theirs.
Use "git push origin master" to update the remote with your changes. 

Congratulations! You completed your first workflow with git!
