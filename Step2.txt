Great job! Now you have a file staged to be commited. How do you know what's staged? Use the command "git status" and you will see 
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

        modified file:   Step1.txt

Go ahead and unstage the file using the command "git rm --cached Step1.txt". Use "git status" again and you will see
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        Step1.txt

Restage the file. Use "git commit ." this time.
Now you are ready to commit. You can do this in 1 line using "git commit -m "Commit Mesage"". It is helpful to enter a descriptive message such as Added refresh button to main screen. This helps the next person see what was changed.
Enter "git commit -m "Added Name to file" and replace "Name" with your name. Now use "git status" again and you will see
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean

Now that the commit is made, it can be viewed by in the log. Use "git log" and you will see your commit at the top of the file.
Use the arrow keys to move up and down and type "q" to quit. This is similar to the VIM editor.
